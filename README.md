# Teeth Brushing Timer
A basic static webpage developed with Javascript & jQuery that helps you brush your teeth for the recomended 2 minutes! 
Every 30 seconds the timer will pause and you will be notified with a pleasant sound that it is time to brush the next quadrant of your teeth. 

I got this idea when I first used an electric toothbrush. I didn't like the brush itself, but it paused every 30 seconds to let you know that you should move onto the next part of your mouth.
So, I thought it would be fun to do a simple web implementation of it for people who don't like or can't afford electric toothbrushes.
