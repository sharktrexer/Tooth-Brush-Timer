# Teeth Brushing Timer
A basic static webpage developed with Javascript & jQuery that notifies you every 30 seconds when it is time to brush the next quadrant of your teeth. 
I got this idea when I first used an electric toothbrush. I didn't like the brush itself, but it stopped every 30 seconds to let you know to move onto the next part of your mouth.
So, I thought it would be fun to do a simple web implementation of it.
