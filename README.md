# Teeth Brushing Timer
A basic static webpage that notifies you every 30 seconds when it is time to brush the next fourth of your teeth. I got this idea when I first used an electric toothbrush and didn't like the brush but liked the timer.
So, I thought it would be fun to do a simple implementation of it.
